# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:
<!-- A parameter is a placeholder for your own knowledge of what you are going to input into the function you are creating. (ex: array, characters, numbers) The argument is interchangeable data you are calling on in order to run the function to get your intended output.  -->

Researched answer: 
<!-- A parameter is a variable declared in the function's definition, to specify what kind of input the function should expect. An argument is the actual data provided to that parameter when the function is called. Parameters are used to define the function's signature, and arguments are the values you pass to the function's parameters when calling the function. -->



2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer:
<!-- Classes are the blueprint for making multiple objects with the same structure, similar to how a recipe for baking cookies can be altered with different flavors but essentially keeping the same structure overall.  -->


Researched answer:
 <!-- An object is an instance of a class or a data structure with key-value pairs, while a class is a blueprint  for creating objects with specific properties and methods. Classes provide a way to create and manage objects with similar structures and behaviors in a more organized and reusable manner. -->


3. What is iteration?

Your answer: 
<!-- Iteration is essentially repeating an action over and over throughout a data type until your specified condition is met.  -->

Researched answer:
<!-- Iteration refers to the process of repeatedly executing a set of statements or operations. It is commonly used to loop through data structures like arrays, objects, or strings to perform actions on their elements. It is a fundamental process used to manipulate data in a controlled manner. -->

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer:
<!-- Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved (or "hoisted") to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that regardless of where variables and functions are declared within a scope, they are read as if they are declared at the top and can be used before their actual declaration in the code, and will still work.  -->

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator:

2. React: 
<!-- React is a JavaScript library, or a collection of node modules, for building UI. It handles user interactions and creates an interactive UI.  -->

3. JSX:
<!-- JavaScript XML; markup lamguage that is a combo of HTML and JS.  -->
