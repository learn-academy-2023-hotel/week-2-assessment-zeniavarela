# ASSESSMENT 2: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure you are progressing in your professional development.

### Portfolios

This week, we covered the importance of a great technical portfolio to help you stand out in the job market.

Spend time looking at other developerâ€™s portfolios. Submit the links to three portfolios you will use for inspiration.
